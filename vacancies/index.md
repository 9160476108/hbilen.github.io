# FAQ

I receive an overwhelming amount of emails from prospective students for PhD, MSc, MPhil. I am sorry if I have not been able to respond to your email. Here is a FAQ that may help you to find answers:

- **Do you accept new students?** Yes, I am always looking for good students. However, I do not have any funding for studentships at the moment.

- **How can I apply for a funding / scholarship?** You can find a guideline [here](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/apply) for the Informatics scholarships. Alternatively you can apply to one of the centres for doctoral training (CDT), [Data Science](http://datascience.inf.ed.ac.uk/) or [Robotics](http://www.edinburgh-robotics.org/).

- **What kind of topics can I work on my PhD?** I am open to take on students for a wide range of topics in the intersection of computer vision, machine learning and deep learning (see my recent [publications](../publications/index.html) to get a sense of what I am currently interested in).

- **Can I be co-supervised?** Yes it is quite common in the School of Informatics. Most PhD students do some collaborative work with other professors.

- **I have decided to apply to one of these programs and I'd like to contact you.** Please e-mail me with the title **[Prospective Student]**. 

- **Do you offer summer projects or internships?** No, unfortunately I am not taking any summer students.

## PhD Studentship: Computer vision and Machine learning in the University of Edinburgh

We are seeking an exceptional UK/EU PhD candidate to study in the prestigious in the Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour ([IPAB](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab)) at the University of Edinburgh. The successful candidate will have an opportunity to work on cutting-edge computer vision and machine learning research projects using Deep Learning. The goal of this project is to develop the next generation of deep learning systems for computer vision with a focus on multiple-task learning from videos. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to collaborate with leading computer vision and machine learning groups in the UK and Europe.

**PhD candidate requirements:** We are looking for creative and motivated applicants with, or expected to obtain soon, a 1st Class Honours degree in a relevant discipline, including Informatics, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering but not limited to. Basic programming skills (python, c++, MATLAB) are required. Previous experience on machine learning and computer vision, for example object and action classification, is appreciated but not a requirement.

**Funding:** This is a University of Edinburgh funded award and will provide an annual stipend for three years of £14,553 per year (subject to confirmation), plus University fees for UK/EU students. Any eligible non-EU candidates must fund the remainder of the overseas tuition fee.

**Application:** If you are interested in the position, please provide a CV, a personal statement detailing your research interests and reasons for applying (max 1 page), marks for your degree(s) and an email address for one academic reference.
