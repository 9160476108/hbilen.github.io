I am a postdoctoral research assistant in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), working with [Andrea Vedaldi](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/). My research focuses on computer vision and machine learning.

Before joining VGG, I completed my PhD in [VISICS](http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) group in [KUL](http://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) under the supervision of Luc Van Gool and worked with [Tinne Tuytelaars](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~tuytelaa/) as a postdoctoral scholar in the same group for a year. My research was about image classification with latent parameters with a focus on weakly supervised object detection and action recognition.

I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from the mechatronics programme of [Sabanci University](http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/) where I was working on micro-robotics with [Mustafa Unel](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/munel/).
