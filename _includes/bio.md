I am a lecturer (assistant professor) in the [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the University of Edinburgh. My research focuses on computer vision and machine learning. Before Edinburgh, I have spent three wonderful years in the great [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the University of Oxford as a postdoc, working with [Andrea Vedaldi](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/). 

I completed my PhD in [VISICS](http://www.esat.kuleuven.be/psi) group in [KU Leuven](http://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/). I was lucky to work with Luc Van Gool and [Tinne Tuytelaars](http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~tuytelaa/). My PhD topic was about image classification with latent parameters with a focus on weakly supervised object detection and action recognition.

My bachelor's and master's degrees from [Sabanci University](http://www.sabanciuniv.edu/) where I was working on micro-robotics with [Mustafa Unel](http://people.sabanciuniv.edu/munel/).
